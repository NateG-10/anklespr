        <h1>What Happens During an Ankle Sprain?</h1>
        <p>Ankle sprains occur when the ankle is either over-rotated inward <strong>(Inversion)</strong> or outward <strong>(Eversion)</strong>.
          The difference between the two lies in the affected ligaments. <strong>Ligaments</strong> are connective tissues composed
          of collagen, a strong protein that resists tension, that attach bones to maintain stability. During an ankle sprain,
          the ligaments are stretched or torn, causing instability and sometimes pain. As shown in the graphic, three grades of ankle sprains 
          describe the severity of the damage to the ligaments. Athletes usually report a "popping" sound or sensation during the injury.

          <h2>Inversion Ankle Sprains</h2>
        <p>When an ankle sprain due to inversion occurs, the affected ligaments lie on the outside of the ankle, which are the
        <strong>Posterior Talofibular Ligament (PTFL)</strong>, <strong>Calcaneofibular Ligament (CFL)</strong>, and <strong>Anterior Talofibular Ligament (ATFL)</strong>.

          <h2>Eversion Ankle Sprains</h2>
        <p>When an ankle sprain due to eversion occurs, the affected ligaments lie on the inside of the ankle, which is a group of ligaments
          simply named the <strong>Deltoid Ligaments</strong>.

          <h1>What Are Some Symptoms of Ankle Sprains?</h1>
        <p>Common symptoms include inflammation, bruising, a feeling of weakness or instability, and pain.
          The severity of these symptoms will increase depending on the grade of ligament tears. If you think
          you've recently had an ankle sprain, contact your doctor for proper diagnosis.
        </p>

        <h1>What Are The Consequences of Ankle Sprains?</h1>
        <p>Ligaments have a low blood supply which makes it much harder for them to heal compared to other body parts (bones, muscles, etc).
          When left untreated, weak ligaments can lead to <strong>Chronic Ankle Joint Instability</strong>, which makes everyday tasks harder and
          makes participation in sports unrealistic. After one sprain, it is much more likely for a ligament to be sprained again because of its weaker
          nature. The prevention of ankle injuries through strengthening ligaments can help avoid such a problem.
