      <h1>What is Prevention?</h1>
        <p>Ankle injury prevention tactics should be employed before an ankle sprain,
          to <strong>prevent</strong> them from happening. These prevention
          tactics are aimed at either strengthening the ligaments or using external support 
          devices to stabilize the ankles.
        </p>
     <br><br>
      <h1>Why is Prevention so Important?</h1>
        <p>
          With ankle sprains, the best case scenario is avoiding the injury completely. Strengthening the ligaments or restricting 
          the ankle's range of motion have been shown by numerous studies as the most effective ways to prevent this injury from happening. If the 
          ankle was left unprotected and the ligaments were left unstrengthened, athletes would be considerably more ussceptible to spraining their ankles and other
          ankle injuries.
        </p>
      <h2>Braces</h2>
        <p>Studies have shown that the frequency of ankle sprains decreases significantly
          when athletes are wearing ankle supports or other types of bracing. By restricting the ankle's range of motion,
          over-rotation is avoided and the ligaments are much less susceptible to tearing. The following image
          shows a more robust support brace (Left), which is more commonly found used by already-injured athletes,
          along with a lighter, more streamlined brace (Right), more commonly found in athletes that just
          want some extra support. For best results, consult with your doctor before picking out a brace to use.

      <h2>Taping</h2>
        <p>For athletes that want lighter options, taping ankles is also a common prevention strategy. Although taping is
          less cost efficient than bracing, and also provides less support overall, it's still better than leaving the ankle
          unsupported. Using sports tape as shown below, a "makeshift brace" can be constructed using the tape. It's important
          to note that taping too tight can cause discomfort and a loss of circulation, and taping too loosely can make the taping
          itself uselss. Visit <strong><a href="https://www.bioped.com/ankle-taping/" class="TextLink" target=_blank>Bioped's
