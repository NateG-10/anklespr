      <h1>Exercises</h1>
        <p>Some of the exercises found here are the same as those found in the treatment section, however the difference in this section
          is that those exercises can be done with more intensity (more weight, reps, resistance, etc) because the ligaments haven't been
          damaged yet. We can also introduce completely new exercises that aren't possible for treatment because the ligaments are too fragile.
        </p>

      <h2>Using Therabands</h2>
      <p>
        Therabands are very useful for ankle ligament strengthening/recovery. These exercises allow for the patient to control the level of resistance dealt with.
        Although most commonly used for rehabilitation (treatment), they can also be used at higher resistances for the strengthening of ligaments 
        before a sprain. In these exercises, the patient must work "against" the resistance bands which tests the ankle's range of mobility as well
        as the strength of the ligaments.</p>

        <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Theraband Inversion</strong></h2>
        <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong>  Create a loop around your foot and knot the band. It should be secure but not too tight. Place the knotted side
          on the outside of the foot. Secure the band using an anchor (like the table in video) and hold the band so it is taught and creates resistance. 
          Turn foot <strong>inwards</strong> and pull the resistance band. Start with <strong>3 sets of 10 reps</strong>. Increase reps/sets/resistance as desired.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Tips:</strong>  Make sure the <strong>rest of the leg doesn't move.</strong> Isolate the movement in the ankle. Make sure the <strong>sole of the foot doesn't turn;</strong> it should stay
          <strong>facing away</strong> from you.</p>

        <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong>  Create a loop around your foot and knot the band. It should be secure but not too tight. Place the knotted side
          on the <strong>inside</strong> of the foot. Secure the band using an anchor (like the table in video) and hold the band so it is taught and creates resistance. 
          Turn foot <strong>outwards</strong> and push the resistance band away. Start with <strong>3 sets of 10 reps</strong>. Increase reps/sets/resistance as desired.

        <p id="landscapevideotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong> Take the resistance band and wrap around the <strong>ball</strong> of the foot. Hold both ends of the  band so it is taught and creates resistance. 
          Point foot <strong>away from you</strong> and push the resistance band away. Start with <strong>3 sets of 10 reps</strong>. Increase <br>reps/sets/resistance as desired.

        <p id="landscapevideotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong> Take the resistance band and wrap around the <strong>top</strong> of the foot. Secure the band using an anchor (like the pole in video) and hold the 
            band so it is taught and creates resistance. Point foot <strong>away from you</strong> and pull the resistance band towards you. Start with <strong>3 sets of 10 reps</strong>. Increase <br>reps/sets/resistance as desired.

        Bosu Ball Exercises
      </h2>
        <p>
            The use of a Bosu ball in exercises introduces instability which in turn makes the targeted body parts "work harder." This progression in
            difficulty and intensity further strengthens the ligaments.
        </p>

            <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Bosu Single Leg Stance</strong></h2>
            <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong> Place the bosu ball next to something you can hold for stability. Step onto the bosu ball with one leg 
                in the center and hold on to your anchor, or, if comfortable enough, hold onto waist. Begin with a <strong>3 sets of 10 seconds.</strong> Increase sets/time as desired.
                <br><br><strong>Tips:</strong>  Start on a <strong>flat surface</strong> if using the bosu ball is too difficult. </p>

        <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Bosu Single Leg Squat</strong></h2>
        <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong> Place the bosu ball next to something you can hold for stability. Step on with one foot 
        in the center and hold on to your anchor. Don't squat all the way down. Begin with larger squat angles and squat down further
        as you get more comfortable. Start with <strong>3 sets of 5 reps.</strong>Increase reps/sets/squat depth as desired.
        <br><br><strong>Tips:</strong>  Make sure your <strong>squatting knee doesn't collapse inward.</strong> Try on a <strong>flat surface</strong> first if using the bosu ball is too difficult.</p>

        <video src="Platform SL Squat.mp4" controls></video>
        <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Platform Single Leg Squat</strong></h2>
        <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:</strong>  Use some sort of elevated platform, such as the adjustable fitness steps used in the platform. Stand on the platform
        so that one leg is hanging off the edge. Hold hands at waist. Squat down so that the hanging foot's heel taps the ground, then come back up. 
        Start with <strong>3 sets of 8 reps.</strong><br><br><strong>Tips:</strong>  Make sure your <strong>squatting knee doesn't collapse 
        inward.</strong> To increase difficulty, squat deeper by <strong>extending your hanging leg farther</strong> so that you have to squat deeper
        in order to tap your heel.</p>

        <video src="boxdrop.mp4" controls></video>
        <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Box Drop</strong></h2>
        <p id="videotext"><strong>Instructions:  </strong>Step onto a ledge or elevated piece of athletic equipment 6-12 inches in height. With two feet
        on the edge drop down onto one foot and slowly enter a slight one-legged squat. Then, either hop back onto the ledge using the squatted
        leg, or step backwards with both feet onto the ledge. Start with <strong>3 sets of 6 reps.</strong>Increase reps/sets/squat depth as desired.
        <br><br><strong>Tips:  </strong>Make sure your <strong>squatting knee doesn't collapse inward.</strong> Start with a shorter ledge to get
        used to the exercise. </p>

        <h2 id="videoheader"><strong>Lateral Jumps</strong></h2>
        <p id="landscapevideotext "><strong>Instructions:  </strong>Stand in an area where you have adequate space to jump side to side. Bend down on one leg, then explode
        onto your other leg, jumping side to side. When landing, bend your knee slightly then explode back onto the original leg. Start with <strong>3 sets of 4 reps 
        </strong> (4 jumps off each leg). Increase reps/sets/squat depth as desired. The point of this exercise is to mimic jumping and cutting movements in sports such as soccer, basketball, and football.
        <br><br><strong>Tips:  </strong>Make sure your <strong>landing knee doesn't collapse inward. </strong> Make an effort to <strong>land softly on your knee</strong>. A hard landing could
        cause knee damage.
