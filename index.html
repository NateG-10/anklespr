        <h1>Why are Ankle Injuries such a Pressing Problem?</h1>
        <p>Ankle injuries are some of the most common in high school athletes 
          and many of these injuries go undiagnosed/untreated because of the 
          lack of knowledge that athletes have about the anatomy of injuries 
          such as ankle sprains. Ankle injuries can
          put star athletes out of commission and prevent them from reaching their full potential. They remain uninformed 
          and continue to injure themselves when these injuries are easily preventable 
          through proper education and caution. Without proper education, the 
          possibility of repeated injury increases.
          However, if athletes overcome these obstacles, 
          more and more can succeed in their respective sports and 
          avoid the possibility of being seriously injured early on in their lives. </p>
      </div>
        
          <h2>Supporting Evidence</h2>
          <p>According to OrthoInfo.org, sprains and ligament tears in the ankles are among the most common injuries in high school athletes participating in high
            contact sports.
            Furthermore, in a survery which asked more than 45 high school athletes of official Virginia High School League (VHSL) sports what the most common injury in their sport was, <strong>almost half responded with ankle sprains:</strong>
